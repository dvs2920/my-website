        <p> Overview
The Status Update and System Review Meeting held on January 16 addressed key developments across communication, financial planning, and procurement systems. The meeting confirmed that the AXA One and POP platforms are now operational, with ongoing efforts to enhance user awareness and incorporate HR communications, while moving forward with the financial crime compliance implementation and preparing for the decommissioning of the Oracle solution post-deployment. Participants discussed delays in the CCXL study and the potential implications for the 2026 budget cycle, with target architecture and business case delivery now set for June. The procurement section covered the onboarding of various sourcing and contract management tools, although a vendor management system is yet to be implemented. Several action items were identified, including follow-ups on discussions with risk teams, HR planning for the POP platform, project timelines, and the vendor management system's status.
