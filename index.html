    <p>Meeting Summary
The meeting focused on testing strategies, tools, and vendor management within ABC. Key topics discussed included automation, performance testing, testing tools, and vendor consolidation.
Key Points:
    1. Automation and Testing Tools:
        â—¦ A variety of automated testing approaches are being used, including UI, API, performance, and desktop-based automation. 
        â—¦ Popular tools include Selenium, Appium, Playwright (POC stage), JMeter, Performance Center, LoadRunner, Gatling (POC stage), and Red Hat OpenShift. 
        â—¦ Shift towards open-source tools to reduce licensing costs, with a focus on tools like Selenium and JMeter. 
    2. Performance Testing Challenges:
        â—¦ Issues with using LoadRunner on Edge due to company policies. 
        â—¦ Some teams are moving from Performance Center to JMeter. 
        â—¦ Investigating the use of virtual machines as a potential workaround. 
    3. Vendor Consolidation:
        â—¦ Historically, multiple vendors were involved, leading to inconsistent practices. 
        â—¦ Plan to consolidate to a single testing vendor to streamline management. 
        â—¦ Considering ABC GBS as a potential internal vendor to maintain knowledge and reduce costs. 
    4. Management and Governance:
        â—¦ Testing Center of Excellence (TCOE) was reintroduced to centralize practices. 
        â—¦ Moving towards fixed, outcome-based contracts instead of time and material. 
        â—¦ Need for clear guidelines for project teams to engage with TCOE. 

Action Items:
    1. Vendor Consolidation:
        â—¦ Finalize the selection of a single testing vendor. 
        â—¦ Evaluate ABC GBS as a potential internal solution. 
        â—¦ Develop a phased transition plan to the selected vendor. 
    2. Performance Testing Issue:
        â—¦ Investigate virtual machine solutions to bypass Edge restrictions. 
        â—¦ Explore alternative open-source tools and resolve authentication issues with JMeter. 
    3. Automation Tool Enhancement:
        â—¦ Continue testing Playwright as an alternative to Selenium. 
        â—¦ Monitor the progress of Gatling as a performance testing tool. 
    4. Documentation and Communication:
        â—¦ Clearly communicate the new vendor strategy and guidelines to all teams. 
        â—¦ Provide training and updates on open-source tool usage and best practices. 

Issues and Challenges:
    1. Performance Testing Tool Restrictions:
        â—¦ LoadRunner issues with Edge browser settings and security policies. 
        â—¦ JMeter limitations related to Microsoft Azure authentication. 
    2. Vendor Dependency:
        â—¦ Risk associated with consolidating to a single vendor. 
        â—¦ Balancing internal knowledge retention with vendor-based testing services. 
    3. Tool Licensing and Cost Management:
        â—¦ Need for a clear strategy on licensing costs and chargebacks. 
        â—¦ Aligning the transition to open-source tools without disrupting current processes. 

breakdown of the issue with Performance Center (LoadRunner) and Edge, as compared to Chrome:
Description:
    â€¢ The problem primarily arises when trying to script using LoadRunner on the Microsoft Edge browser. 
    â€¢ Moises attempted to help with this issue but concluded that the problem is likely due to specific settings within the ZZZ environment rather than a fundamental incompatibility between LoadRunner and Edge. 
    â€¢ Fiddler was also attempted as a workaround for recording scripts, but it generates a lot of unwanted requests, which complicates the process and requires additional effort to filter them out. 
ðŸ’¡ Why Chrome Works Better:
    â€¢ Chrome works fine because the testing environment and tools are already well-integrated with it. 
    â€¢ However, due to security policies and restrictions at ZZZ, Chrome is not permitted for this purpose. 
ðŸ”’ Security Restrictions:
    â€¢ Any attempt to use Chrome results in immediate incident detection by the security system, which restricts its usage. 
    â€¢ Even if Chrome is technically available, it's practically unusable due to the detection and security protocols. 
ðŸ’¡ Proposed Workarounds:
    1. Using Virtual Machines:
        â—¦ Setting up a dedicated VM at ABC Operation level to circumvent restrictions. 
        â—¦ This would allow testing tools like Performance Center to work without triggering security incidents. 
    2. Investigating Edge Restrictions:
        â—¦ Understanding why Edge specifically blocks or limits LoadRunner scripting. 
        â—¦ It could be due to how LoadRunner interacts with Edge or some particular settings or configurations applied to Edge in the ZZZ environment. 
    3. Further Testing & Collaboration:
        â—¦ Moises and Dominique are working to find alternative solutions or workarounds. 
        â—¦ Moises has been assigned to look into potential fixes or alternative methods to unblock the issue. 
    4. Using HAR Files & JMeter:
        â—¦ In the interim, teams are using HAR files and JMeter as alternatives. 
        â—¦ However, JMeter is facing issues with Microsoft Azure authentication, which needs resolution.
